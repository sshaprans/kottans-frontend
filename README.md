## Git & Github

Passing the course from kottans front-end
Now i can say that the course is well written and structured.

Although I've only just started going through it, I've already learned a lot.
I liked the preparation process and practical tasks. I hope this will help me finish all the tasks in time.

A lot of the material was new to me;
Surprised how many options there are to solve the problem;
I will use the command git pool  the most in the future);

<sup> Thank you for the opportunity, I will continue </sup>
